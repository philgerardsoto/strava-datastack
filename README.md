## Setup
Install required dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```
*[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is being used as the preferred package manager for this project; if you are unfamiliar with `uv`:*
  - `uv sync` = `poetry install`
  - `uv run my_script.py` = `poetry run my_script.py` = `source .venv/bin/activate && python my_script.py`
  - `uv run dlt --help` = `source .venv/bin/activate && dlt --help`

### Strava Auth
#### Create your own [Strava API Application](https://www.strava.com/settings/api)
This is necessary to generate the credentials (e.g. `client_id`, `client_secret`, etc.) you will supply to the strava resource in `strava.py`. Don't worry, creating an application is just a few clicks.

(*full details on the process of creating an app are supplied by strava [here](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#account)*)

#### Review App
Once your app has been created, it will come with a refresh token and an access token. For the purposes of this setup (i.e. creating an automated `dlt` pipeline to export your strava data), these are utterly useless.

</div><br>

- The initial Access Token expires after 6 hours and will need updating (this is how strava manages access tokens)
- The intial Refresh Token is minimally scoped with `read` access which does not allow viewing of activity data (there is a seperate `activity:read` scope that must be granted to a token to view activity data)

To get around these issues, we will create a new refresh token with the proper scopes that we can pass `dlt`.

`dlt` can then use this refresh token that has already been authorized to fetch an up-to-date access token whenever it runs.

#### Generating new refresh token with proper scopes:
(*these steps were ripped from the [Strava developer docs](https://developers.strava.com/docs/getting-started/#oauth)*)
1. Paste the Client ID from your app into this URL where `[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID]` is, and specify the required scopes where `[INSERT_SCOPES]` is:
    ```text
    https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=[REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID]&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http://localhost/exchange_token&approval_prompt=force&scope=[INSERT_SCOPES]
    ```
    *note: in order to get full read access to both your public and private data, these are the necessary [scopes]([scopes](https://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/#detailsaboutrequestingaccess))*
    ```text
    read_all,activity:read_all,profile:read_all
    ```

2. Paste the updated URL into a browser, hit enter, and follow authorization prompts.

3. After authorizaiton, you should get a "This site can't be reached" error. Copy the authorization code (i.e. the `code=` value) from the returned URL.

</div><br>

4. Run a cURL request to generate the refresh token that `dlt` will use:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://www.strava.com/oauth/token \
      -F client_id=YOURCLIENTID \
      -F client_secret=YOURCLIENTSECRET \
      -F code=AUTHORIZATIONCODE \
      -F grant_type=authorization_code
    ```
5. If successful, the response will return a json payload with a `refresh_token` (save this)

#### `secrets.toml` setup
`dlt` offers various methods for [storing connection credentials](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/credentials/);

shown below is an example `secrets.toml` for the strava connection secrets:
```toml
[sources.strava.credentials]
access_token_url = "https://www.strava.com/oauth/token"
client_id = "<your_client_id>"
client_secret = "<your_client_secret>"
refresh_token = "<your_refresh_token>"
```

## Usage
### `dlt`
With crendentials defined, the strava datastack dlt pipeline can be run via:
```bash
uv run strava.py
```
By default, this will just load the last 30 days of data.<br>
>This is done as Strava limits read requests to 1000/day. Depending on how many years of Strava data you have / number of total activities, you may need to break up your initial historical load across multiple days. It's recommended to start with a few months at first to get a sense for how many requests that is. Fair warning: if your timespan is too large, and you hit the daily request limit, the pipeline will error and you will need to retry loading all that data (modified with a smaller time window) the following day.

#### Historical loads & backfills
To complete a larger, historical load, or run a backfill, you can pass in a `--start-date` and `--end-date`.

Initial load with data starting from January 2024\*
```bash
uv run strava.py --start-date='2024-01-01'
```
<br>

Backfill data starting from January 2024 up until July 2024
```bash
uv run strava.py --start-date='2024-01-01' --end-date='2024-07-01'
```

*\***Note**: if you have already run the pipeline once, you will have a `last_value` saved in your state, and you will need to provide an `--end-date` to temporarily override this (if you don't, your pipeline will think it is already up to date and not properly backfill)*

You can check this stored `last_value` at any time by making use of the `-v` flag:
```bash
uv run dlt pipeline -v strava_datastack info
```

An example of the relevant output as it relates to `last_value`:
```json
sources:
{
  "strava": {
    "resources": {
      "activities": {
        "incremental": {
          "start_date": {
            "initial_value": "2024-11-16T00:00:00Z",
            "last_value": "2024-12-15T20:48:45Z",
            "unique_hashes": [
              "k3Za3tV8zvNDwCyexCJQ"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Local state:
first_run: False
_last_extracted_at: 2024-12-16 05:00:59.894989+00:00
_last_extracted_hash: QeJ5iEmeeGmB3zs5XxaM1oRvcARLpgsmifRxmxj84Og=
