    description: >
      One row per activity data point (Strava records 1 data point per second)
      where all types of streams (time, power, velocity, etc. ) have been pivoted to their own columns.
    columns:
      - name: activity_data_point_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: is_moving
        description: >
          Flag to denote whether athlete was moving at this instance of time.

      - name: grade
        description: >
          The "smoothed" (or whole number) grade provided by Strava.
          Unable to calculate an actual grade because it would require a finer granularity
          than meters for altitude (i.e. ascent often happens at a rate of < 1 m/s).
        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: velocity
        description: >
          The exact velocity at each stream index calculated via
          `distance_delta` / `time_delta`.
        tests:
          - not_null:
              config:
                # it's possible to have an activity with 0 total distance recorded
                # in this case, the distance at each stream index will be null
                where: "distance is not null"
      
      - name: velocity_smooth
        description: >
          The "smoothed" (or whole number) velocity provided by Strava (in meters/second).
          When the `time_delta` = 1, this is accurate; however, when the `time_delta` > 1
          (i.e. there are larger time gaps between stream indexes) this is not as accurate
          as 1 m/s = 2.2mph = 3.6 kph which can result in significant discrepencies
          between the smoothed and actual values.
        tests:
          - not_null
      
      - name: distance_delta
        description: >
          Calculates the distance between stream points.
          For use in calcaulting the exact velocity at each stream index.
      
      - name: time_delta
        description: >
          Calculates the time bewteen stream data points.
          Ideally, a stream records 1 data point per second, however,
          this can vary based on the GPS device used (sampling rates can differ across devices),
          activity type, whether or not "battery saver" mode on the device is enabled, etc.
        tests:
          # There are small instances of time_delta = 0 as it's
          # possible (though rare) for streams to get written twice
          # (e.g. two rows for an activity where time = 300)
