      One row per activity per zone.
      For instance, if heart rate data is captured for an activity,
      there will be 5 rows representing the 5 different heart rate zones
      (and the time spent in them during the activity).
      Same with respect to the other zone types of power and pace.
    columns:
      - name: activity_zone_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null

      - name: zone_index
